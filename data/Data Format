In the input file, each line represents an instance and is formatted as follows:

idx, V, Q,Spd1, ..., SpdV, N, SrvT, S, Rmax, Dist00, ..., Dist0N, Dist10, ..., Dist1N, ..., DistN0, ..., DistNN, d1, p1, ..., dN, pN, LS1, US1, ..., LSs, USs, a1, b1, ..., aN, bN, Ckm1, ..., CkmV, CFix11, CFix12, ..., CFixV3,CFs11, CFs12, ..., CFsV3,

The variables have the following meaning:
idx	Instance index
V	Number of vehicles
Q	Vehicle capacity
Spdv	Average speed of vehicles
N	Number of customers
SrvT	Service time of loading or unloading per item. It is same for both vehicles. If there are 6 deliveries and 4 pickup items for a customer and Srvt=0.14, vehicle spends 1.4 time(0.14*10) on that customer.
S	Number of shifts
Rmax	Maximum number of tours.//Vehicles can perform maximum 3 tours. For example: following trip has 2 tours 0-1-2-0-3-4-5-0 whereas this tour has 3 tours 0-1-0-2-3-0-3-4-5-0.
Distij	Distance between nodes i and j (Node 0 is the depot)
di	Delivery demand of customer i
pi	Pickup demand of customer i
LSs	Shift start time
USs	Shift end time
ai	Customer opening time
bi	Customer closing time
Ckmv	Cost of vehicle per kilometer 
CFixvr	Fixed cost of vehicle for tour r. If vehicle performs 1st tour, it pays 500. If it performs 2nd or 3rd  tour it pays 1. These costs encourage vehicles to visit more than more customer and perform multi trip.
CFsvs	Fixed cost of vehicle for shift s (per hour). If vehicle visits customer between  0-76.6669, it pays 1500. If it visits between 76.667-153.3299, it pays 2000. Else if it visits between 153.33-230, it pays 2500.
